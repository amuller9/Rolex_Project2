## Project

This second project is about the classification of tweets (from disaster tweet to non-disaster tweet) using different machine learning algorithms.

This notebooks provides details on the dataset, on the algorithms chosen and completed with a youtube video.

## Execution

In order to get all the information, you should download the principal Notebook [Main_Notebook_Rolex.ipynb] and run it using [Jupyter], or online by using [Google Collab] or [Azure Notebooks]. After going through the notebook, you can watch a recap from this YouTube video [https://youtu.be/oogpa4BV2Qo] that will provide an overview of the project.
